Giphy Fun!

This page will generate some buttons that when clicked call the Giphy API to populate 10 gifs of that category. When populated, the static image is loaded, and they can be clicked to start and stop playing the gifs. When any button is clicked, the old gifs clear and the new gifs appear. The search bar allows users to add their own custom buttons to the page (locally) which will function just as the other buttons do, calling the Giphy API, and populating the gif images with the ability to start and stop playing the gifs.

This was homework assignment 6 of the University of Richmond Coding Bootcamp, fall 2018.
