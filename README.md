# Giphy Fun!

This is a simple application using the Giphy API and AJAX calls so the client/user can generate, start, and stop gifs of any category.

## How it Works

On page load the client/user will see some buttons automatically generated for them to interact with. If they click these buttons, gifs of those categories appear on the page, but are static images. The user must click on the images for the gifs to start/stop playing. In addition, the user may add their own buttons via the input field and submit button. Then their own new button will appear, just like the ones generated on page load, and they can now click it to view gifs of the category they added.

### Technologies

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, Giphy API

### Future Development

The design of this page could be improved upon, especially utilizing Bootstrap in better ways. Additional CSS could be added to the gifs once they are populated as well. Additional usage of the Giphy API, as well as calling other API's could make this a more interactive application as well.
